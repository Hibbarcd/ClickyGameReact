This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



In the project directory, you can run with yarn start

The game is designed to utilize react rendering to generate a game in which the user must click on any available image. They are awarded one point per click, up to twelve required to win, but clicking on the same image twice results in a loss and restarts the game score to zero. High scores are saved into an array for later reference.

**Mobile friendly also, however fully compatibility not guaranteed for all mobile devices.
